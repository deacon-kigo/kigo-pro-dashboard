# ADR-001: Adoption of Atomic Design Structure

## Context

The kigo-pro-dashboard project needs a scalable, maintainable component organization system. With the growing number of UI components, we need a structure that:
- Makes components easier to find and reuse
- Provides clear guidelines for where new components should be placed
- Supports future Storybook documentation
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Decision

We will adopt the Atomic Design methodology to organize our UI components, with the following structure:

```
/src/components
  /atoms        # Basic UI building blocks
  /molecules    # Simple combinations of atoms
  /organisms    # Complex UI sections
  /templates    # Page layouts
  /shared       # Shared utilities
```

Each component will be organized in its own directory with consistent file naming:

```
/ComponentName
  index.ts                 # Exports
  ComponentName.tsx        # Component code
  ComponentName.stories.tsx # Storybook documentation
  ComponentName.test.tsx    # Tests (when applicable)
```

## Rationale

- **Scalability**: Atomic Design provides a clear mental model for scaling a component library
- **Reusability**: Makes it easier to find and reuse components based on their complexity
- **Storybook Integration**: Aligns perfectly with Storybook documentation by providing natural categorization
- **Industry Standard**: Used by many design systems and component libraries
- **Developer Experience**: Makes it easier for new developers to understand where components belong
- **Consistency with kigo-admin-tools**: Aligns with the structure used in related repositories

Alternatives considered:
- **Feature-based organization**: While useful for some aspects, it makes component reuse across features more difficult
- **Flat component structure**: Doesn't scale well with growing component libraries
- **Technical/functional classification**: Less intuitive than the visual/compositional approach of Atomic Design

## Consequences

Positive:
- Better organization and discoverability of components
- Clear guidelines for component development
- Natural structure for Storybook documentation
- Improved component reuse

Negative:
- Initial refactoring effort to move existing components
- Potential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Atomic Design
- Some components may not fit cleanly into a single category

## Status

Accepted
