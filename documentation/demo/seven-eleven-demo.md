Kigo PRO AI Agent Demo Script - 7-Eleven

Introduction (30 seconds)

"Today I'll demonstrate how Kigo PRO's intelligent agents transform merchant operations through AI automation. We'll see how tasks that previously took weeks now happen in minutes, while delivering superior results. For this demonstration, we're using 7-Eleven as our example merchant."

Scene 1: Agent-Driven Merchant Onboarding (1.5 minutes)

[SHOW: Kigo PRO login screen transitioning to "New Merchant Onboarding" section]

"Traditionally, onboarding a merchant like 7-Eleven would take our teams weeks of effort – configuring hundreds of locations, mapping product catalogs, setting up validation rules, and more. With our intelligent agent, this process is now completed in minutes."

[SHOW: Agent interface with conversation input]

"Our operator simply types: 'Onboard 7-Eleven as a new merchant partner with their complete US store network and standard product catalog.'"

[SHOW: AI working through onboarding steps with progress indicators]

"The agent automatically:

Accesses 7-Eleven's location database to import and validate 13,000+ store locations

Geocodes each location for precise targeting

Ingests their standard product catalog with 4,200+ items and maps it to our category taxonomy

Sets up default permissions and user roles according to 7-Eleven's organizational structure

Creates the merchant branding profile with logo, color schemes, and style guidelines"

13,284 locations across all 50 states

"Beyond simple reporting, the agent continuously analyzes performance patterns and proactively recommends optimizations:"

[SHOW: Optimization recommendations]

"Optimization Alert: I've identified several opportunities to improve campaign performance:

Regional Performance Variance: Florida locations are outperforming Texas by 37% in conversion rate. Recommendation: Shift budget allocation to 60% Florida/40% Texas.

Daypart Optimization: Orders between 6-8pm show highest conversion rates and larger basket sizes. Recommendation: Increase budget allocation during this timeframe by 25%.

Audience Refinement: Users within actual delivery radius (vs. standard geo-targeting) show 52% higher conversion rates. Recommendation: Switch to delivery zone targeting using 7-Eleven's actual service boundaries.

Creative Messaging Performance: Adding 'No Minimum Order' messaging increased click-through rate by 31% in test markets. Recommendation: Update creative across all placements.

Market Expansion Opportunity: Based on demographic and behavioral similarities to high-performing Florida markets, the agent has identified Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama as prime expansion candidates. Recommendation: Extend campaign to these markets with a 15% test budget allocation."

[SHOW: One-click implementation option]

"With a single click, 7-Eleven can approve these recommendations, and the agent will automatically implement all adjustments. The continuous optimization cycle ensures the campaign consistently improves performance over time, maximizing ROI for 7-Eleven's 7NOW app promotion."
