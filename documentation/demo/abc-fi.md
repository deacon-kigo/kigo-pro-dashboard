Design Brief & Interactive Storyboard: Kigo PRO Demo
Project: Kigo PRO AI-Powered Campaign Creation Demo
Designer: Deacon
Objective: To create a precise, interactive, and visually compelling demo that functions as a self-guided product tour. The demo must walk a user through a specific, pre-scripted narrative from goal to ROI.
Target User Persona: Tucker, a hands-on Marketing Manager at "ABC FI" (a regional financial institution).

Core Narrative
Tucker, a Marketing Manager at ABC FI, logs into Kigo PRO to find ways to boost customer engagement. Using the Kigo AI agent, he is guided to a high-value "New Homebuyer" segment. In minutes, he co-creates a targeted, partner-funded welcome campaign and sees a clear, positive ROI model, ready to be actioned.

Scene 1: Opportunity Discovery
Goal: To demonstrate Kigo's ability to instantly transform a generic marketing goal into specific, data-backed opportunities.
Step 1.1: Initial View - The Dashboard
UI State: The demo begins on the main Kigo PRO Dashboard. This screen should feel alive with data and provide a snapshot of the overall health of the "ABC FI Rewards Program."

On-Screen Script (in Chat Window):
Kigo Agent: "Excellent choice. That aligns perfectly with the mortgage team's goals. Based on our network data, new homeowners are highly receptive to welcome offers. Here is a campaign plan I've drafted."
On-Screen Elements (Main View - The Campaign Plan): This needs to be highly visual and well-organized.
Header: New Homeowner Welcome Campaign
Section 1: The Offer - A $100 Congratulatory Gift
Visually display three choices side-by-side. Each choice needs an image and the supporting text:
Option A: $100 Home Depot Gift Card. Insight: 78% of new homeowners visit a home improvement store within 30 days of moving.

Goal: To make the campaign's outcome tangible by showing exactly what the new homeowner will see.
Step 3.1: Showing the Mobile Experience
UI State: A clean, animated modal window appears, containing a mock-up of a smartphone. The phone screen should animate through a 3-step sequence.
Sequence (On the simulated phone screen):
Screen 1: Push Notification. A notification banner appears at the top of a generic phone screen.

Step 4.1: The Critical Question
User Action: Tucker types his final question into the chat.
On-Screen Script (in Chat Window):
Tucker: "This is great. What will this cost and how much incremental revenue will it generate for us?"
Step 4.2: The ROI Model
UI State: The campaign plan view transitions to a final, clean, and simple financial model/calculator. The numbers should be pre-populated and calculate automatically.
On-Screen Script (in Chat Window):
Kigo Agent: "Great question. Let me pull together a simple model quickly."
On-Screen Elements (Main View - The Financial Model):
Header: Projected Monthly ROI: New Homeowner Campaign
Column 1: Inputs
Monthly Mortgage Closings: 567
Cost Per Gift: $100.00
Advertiser Co-op Funding: 40%
Column 2: Outputs (Calculated)
Total Monthly Program Cost: $56,700 (Calculation: 567 _ $100)
Net Cost to Bank: $34,020 (Calculation: $56,700 _ (1 - 0.40))
Est. Incremental Revenue: $45,360 (Assumption: 20% of customers take a follow-up offer generating ~$400 in value)
Projected Monthly ROI: +33% (Calculation: (($45,360 - $34,020) / $34,020) \* 100)

Final UI & Visual Guidance

Visual Identity: This entire flow must adhere to the existing Kigo PRO visual identity and UI kit that you are currently working with. Please ensure consistency in fonts, colors, spacing, and component design.
Interactivity & Polish: Transitions between scenes must be fluid and seamless. The appearance of elements should be gracefully animated to guide the user's eye and create a polished, professional feel. The experience should feel responsive and fast.

Part 3: The Customer Journey - Sarah's Experience (5-6 minutes)
Scene 1: The Personalized New Mover Journey (2.5 minutes)
The Notification: We meet Sarah, a new ABC FI mortgage customer. Her iPhone lights up with a push notification: "Congratulations on the purchase of your new home in Denver! We have a housewarming gift for you."
The AI Agent - Part 1 (Gifting): She taps the notification, and the ABC FI app opens to the AI agent. It offers her three personalized gift choices based on her profile (e.g., a restaurant, a home goods store, a local service).
Sarah selects a $100 gift card for a popular Italian restaurant. The agent instantly delivers the digital gift card to her Kigo Hub.
The AI Agent - Part 2 (Planning):
Agent: "Is there anything else we can help you with to plan your move?"
Sarah types: "I need to plan the move"
Agent: "Of course. Here are some offers to help with your move to Denver:"
The agent immediately presents the curated "Moving Journey" bundle Tucker created, including personalized offers for U-Haul, Public Storage, and a Hilton hotel near her new home.
Action: Impressed, Sarah saves all the moving offers to her Kigo Hub.

Scene 2: The Coffee Conquest (1.5 minutes)
The Intervention: Days later, Sarah is in Denver. Walking past a Starbucks, she receives the geofenced push notification from the "Coffee Switch" campaign: "Time for a new coffee routine, Sarah? Earn 1,000 bonus points..."
The Decision: Intrigued by the high-value, brand-funded offer, she decides to try Starbucks.
The Transaction: She makes her purchase with her ABC FI card, and a second notification instantly confirms that 1,000 bonus points have been added to her account.

Scene 3: The Payoff & Business Impact (1 minute)
Backend View: The demo shows the Kigo PRO dashboard with metrics tracking the "Coffee Switch" campaign's success, showing a clear ROI for Starbucks.
Reward Redemption: The combined points from the moving offers and the coffee switch push Sarah's points balance over the threshold, allowing her to redeem a "Family Fun Package" through the AI agent.
The Flywheel: The demo concludes by showing the powerful synergy: Starbucks acquired a new customer. Sarah received significant, personalized value. ABC FI facilitated the connection, earning revenue and deepening Sarah's engagement and loyalty.
