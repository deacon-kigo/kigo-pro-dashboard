Core Narrative
Tucker, a Marketing Manager at ABC FI, logs into Kigo PRO to find ways to boost customer engagement. Using the Kigo AI agent, he is guided to a high-value "New Homebuyer" segment. In minutes, he co-creates a targeted, partner-funded welcome campaign and sees a clear, positive ROI model, ready to be actioned.

On-Screen Elements (Main View - The Campaign Plan): This needs to be highly visual and well-organized.
Header: New Homeowner Welcome Campaign

Section 1: The Offer - A $100 Congratulatory Gift
Visually display three choices side-by-side. Each choice needs an image and the supporting text:

These will be immediately available to the new home owner, ready for them to use during their move and as they get settled. Here are partner brands and offers relevant to new home buyers and relocation services"

Step 4.1: The Critical Question
