Part 1: Marketing Journey - Campaign #1: AI-Powered New Mover Journey (2-3 minutes)
Insight: In Kigo PRO, our marketer, Tucker, sets a strategic Q4 objective to increase engagement among new mortgage customers. The AI-Agent recommends an "AI-Powered New Mover Journey" that begins with a personalized gift.
Action: Tucker uses the Kigo PRO campaign builder to architect the conversational experience.
Conversational Flow:
Step 1: The Gift: He configures the AI-powered gifting moment, setting the value at $100 and enabling "AI Gift Personalization" to ensure the options are hyper-relevant to each user.
Step 2: The Follow-Up: He then adds a second step to the conversational flow. He programs the agent to ask, "Is there anything else we can help you with to plan your move?"
Step 3: The Journey Bundle: He links a pre-built "Moving Journey" offer bundle to this conversational path. This bundle contains offers for brands like U-Haul, Public Storage, and Hilton hotels.
Launch: Tucker launches the automated campaign, which will now guide new homeowners through this multi-step, value-driven conversation.

Part 2: Marketing Journey - Campaign #2: Brand-Funded Conquesting (2 minutes)
Insight: Tucker is in Kigo PRO, reviewing partnership opportunities. The AI-Agent surfaces a strategic insight: "Our partner, Starbucks, has allocated a Q4 budget to acquire new customers. We have identified a segment of 50,000 ABC FI members who frequently buy coffee at competitor locations... This is a prime audience for a conquesting campaign."
Action: Tucker uses Kigo PRO to build a "Coffee Switch" campaign on behalf of Starbucks.
Audience: He creates a precise conquesting segment: "Members with 3+ coffee purchases at competitor locations in the last 30 days AND zero Starbucks transactions in the last 180 days."
Offer: He sets up a simple, high-value, brand-funded offer: "Earn 1,000 Bonus ABC FI Points on your first purchase at any Starbucks." The Kigo PRO interface clearly shows that the point liability is funded by the advertiser (Starbucks).
Launch: He configures the campaign for delivery via a geofenced push notification when a targeted user is near a Starbucks location and launches the campaign.

Part 3: The Customer Journey - Sarah's Experience (5-6 minutes)
Scene 1: The Personalized New Mover Journey (2.5 minutes)
The Notification: We meet Sarah, a new ABC FI mortgage customer. Her iPhone lights up with a push notification: "Congratulations on the purchase of your new home in Denver! We have a housewarming gift for you."
The AI Agent - Part 1 (Gifting): She taps the notification, and the ABC FI app opens to the AI agent. It offers her three personalized gift choices based on her profile (e.g., a restaurant, a home goods store, a local service).
Sarah selects a $100 gift card for a popular Italian restaurant. The agent instantly delivers the digital gift card to her Kigo Hub.
The AI Agent - Part 2 (Planning):
Agent: "Is there anything else we can help you with to plan your move?"
Sarah types: "I need to plan the move"
Agent: "Of course. Here are some offers to help with your move to Denver:"
The agent immediately presents the curated "Moving Journey" bundle Tucker created, including personalized offers for U-Haul, Public Storage, and a Hilton hotel near her new home.
Action: Impressed, Sarah saves all the moving offers to her Kigo Hub.

Scene 2: The Coffee Conquest (1.5 minutes)
The Intervention: Days later, Sarah is in Denver. Walking past a Starbucks, she receives the geofenced push notification from the "Coffee Switch" campaign: "Time for a new coffee routine, Sarah? Earn 1,000 bonus points..."
The Decision: Intrigued by the high-value, brand-funded offer, she decides to try Starbucks.
The Transaction: She makes her purchase with her ABC FI card, and a second notification instantly confirms that 1,000 bonus points have been added to her account.

Scene 3: The Payoff & Business Impact (1 minute)
Backend View: The demo shows the Kigo PRO dashboard with metrics tracking the "Coffee Switch" campaign's success, showing a clear ROI for Starbucks.
Reward Redemption: The combined points from the moving offers and the coffee switch push Sarah's points balance over the threshold, allowing her to redeem a "Family Fun Package" through the AI agent.
The Flywheel: The demo concludes by showing the powerful synergy: Starbucks acquired a new customer. Sarah received significant, personalized value. ABC FI facilitated the connection, earning revenue and deepening Sarah's engagement and loyalty.
