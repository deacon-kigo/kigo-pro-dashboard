# Deacon's Pizza AI Campaign Creation Demo Specification

## Overview

This document specifies the implementation details for a next-generation AI-assisted campaign creation experience for Kigo Pro, focused on demonstrating how AI can transform marketing for time-constrained small business owners like Deacon's Pizza.

## Core Concept & Narrative

The demo follows this narrative: "As the owner of Deacon's Pizza, you're constantly busy making pizzas, managing staff, and handling operations. You don't have time for complex marketing tasks like designing creatives, writing copy, or analyzing performance data. Kigo Pro's AI assistant handles all these mundane tasks while keeping you in control of what matters."

## UI Architecture

Implement a dynamic dual-interface system:

1. **Chat Panel** (left side): Conversational AI interface that guides the process
2. **Dynamic Canvas** (right side): Interactive workspace that evolves throughout the journey, displaying:
   - Real-time campaign visualizations
   - Generated creative assets
   - Interactive data visualizations
   - Configurable campaign elements

## Detailed User Journey

### 1. Entry Experience & Business Intelligence

### Simulated AI Generation

```javascript
// Example of simulated asset generation
const simulateAssetGeneration = async (campaignType, brandColors) => {
  // Show "generating" state
  setGenerationStatus('creating');
  
  // Simulate network delay for realism
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2500));
  
  // Return pre-created assets based on campaign type
  return {
    heroImage: `/assets/${campaignType}/hero.png`,
    socialMedia: {
      instagram: `/assets/${campaignType}/instagram.png`,
      facebook: `/assets/${campaignType}/facebook.png`,
      twitter: `/assets/${campaignType}/twitter.png`,
    },
    emailTemplate: `/assets/${campaignType}/email.png`,
    inStoreSignage: `/assets/${campaignType}/signage.png`,
    loyaltyCard: `/assets/${campaignType}/loyalty.png`,
  };
};

// Simulate performance prediction
const simulateCampaignPerformance = (params) => {
  const baseRedemptionRate = 0.03; // 3%
  const baseViewCount = 3600;
  
  // Apply modifiers based on parameters
  let modifiedRate = baseRedemptionRate;
  if (params.timing.includes('Weekend')) modifiedRate *= 1.2;
  if (params.target === 'Families') modifiedRate *= 1.15;
  if (params.discountPercentage > 25) modifiedRate *= 1.1;
  
  // Calculate ranges for realistic variation
  const viewsMin = Math.round(baseViewCount * 0.9);
  const viewsMax = Math.round(baseViewCount * 1.1);
  
  const redemptionsMin = Math.round(viewsMin * modifiedRate * 0.9);
  const redemptionsMax = Math.round(viewsMax * modifiedRate * 1.1);
  
  // Return prediction data
  return {
    views: { min: viewsMin, max: viewsMax },
    redemptions: { min: redemptionsMin, max: redemptionsMax },
    revenue: {
      min: Math.round(redemptionsMin * params.averageTicket * 0.9),
      max: Math.round(redemptionsMax * params.averageTicket * 1.1)
    },
    costPerAcquisition: {
      min: 0.83,
      max: 1.25
    }
  };
};
```

### Campaign State Management

```javascript
// Central campaign state management
const campaignState = {
  selectedTemplate: null,
  offerDetails: {
    name: '',
    price: 24.99,
    items: ['large-pizza', 'breadsticks', 'soda'],
    discountPercentage: 30,
  },
  targeting: {
    audience: 'families',
    radius: 5,
    days: ['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday'],
    timeRange: '4pm-8pm',
  },
  schedule: {
    startDate: null,
    endDate: null,
    duration: 21, // days
  },
  assets: {}, // Will hold generated assets
  predictions: {}, // Will hold performance predictions
};

// React state hook to manage this state
const [campaign, setCampaign] = useState(campaignState);

// Update function that triggers asset regeneration when needed
const updateCampaign = (updates) => {
  const newState = {...campaign, ...updates};
  setCampaign(newState);
  
  // Check if we need to regenerate assets
  if (needsAssetRegeneration(updates)) {
    regenerateAffectedAssets(newState);
  }
  
  // Always update performance predictions
  updatePerformancePredictions(newState);
};
```

## Demo Narrative Focus Points

For the demonstration, emphasize these key moments:

1. **Time-Saving Value Proposition**:
   - Highlight how the entire process takes minutes instead of hours
   - Emphasize how mundane tasks (design, copywriting) are automated
   - Show how a busy restaurant owner can create professional marketing without technical skills

2. **Complete Asset Generation**:
   - Focus on the quality and comprehensiveness of AI-generated assets
   - Demonstrate how everything is created with brand consistency
   - Show the "regenerate" capabilities for customization

3. **Real-Time Adaptation**:
   - Showcase how all assets update instantly when parameters change
   - Demonstrate the "what-if" scenarios for performance optimization
   - Show how the AI learns from user preferences

4. **Business Intelligence**:
   - Emphasize how the AI provides valuable insights without asking
   - Show competitive analysis features
   - Demonstrate performance prediction capabilities

5. **One-Click Operations**:
   - Showcase how complex tasks can be completed with minimal clicks
   - Demonstrate the "optimize for me" features
   - Show the streamlined launch process

## Implementation Priorities

If time is limited, focus on implementing these core elements first:

1. The split-screen interface with AI chat and canvas
2. Business intelligence visualizations
3. Campaign option generation with sample assets
4. Interactive parameters with real-time updates
5. Performance prediction dashboard with what-if capabilities

Secondary elements to add if time permits:

1. Asset regeneration capabilities
2. Advanced animations and transitions
3. Detailed optimization suggestions
4. Comprehensive asset gallery
5. Launch experience and follow-up intelligence

The demo should ultimately convey that Kigo Pro's AI assistant isn't just saving time—it's creating better campaigns than the merchant could make themselves, backed by data and professional quality assets that would normally require significant time and expense to produce.
