# Kigo Pro Research Summary

## Executive Summary

Our comprehensive research across key stakeholders reveals that Kigo Pro has significant opportunity to transform current fragmented processes into a cohesive, scalable platform while addressing the diverse needs of different user segments.

## Key Findings

1. **System Integration Challenges:** Current fragmented systems (MCM, MOM, Salesforce, HubSpot) create inefficiencies, with data duplication and ETL failures causing incomplete reporting.

2. **Customer Journey Gaps:** Data collection focuses primarily on redemption intent, missing critical earlier stages of the customer journey. This was described as "trying to tell the whole story with just the last two chapters."

3. **Tension Between Custom and Standardized Solutions:** A fundamental tension exists between the entrepreneurial "sell what the market wants" approach creating custom solutions and the need for standardized, scalable products.

4. **White-glove vs. Self-service Requirements:** Different customer segments have vastly different needs – from high-paying clients expecting personalized service to others who would benefit from self-service tools.

5. **Analytics as Competitive Differentiator:** Enhanced analytics capabilities represent a key competitive advantage, as competitors provide minimal data to clients.

6. **AI Opportunity:** Significant potential exists for AI integration across multiple use cases – from predictive campaign performance to automated asset collection and data summarization.

7. **Merchant Communication Challenges:** Reduced merchant communication frequency (quarterly vs. monthly) may correlate with increased "not honoring" issues where merchants fail to recognize promotional offers.

8. **Benchmarking Need:** Clients consistently ask if their results are "good," highlighting the need for comparative benchmarking data.

9. **Data Digestibility:** Users need digestible data summaries rather than raw numbers to extract meaningful insights. Clients often struggle to interpret raw data and require explanations.

10. **Technical Architecture Direction:** Research indicates a preference for a monolithic approach over microservices for more efficient development and data consistency.

11. **Legacy System Limitations:** Current systems were described as "clunky" with limited ability to make changes, creating significant barriers to innovation.

12. **Implementation Complexity:** Enterprise solutions must accommodate varying levels of technical capability across dealers/locations, requiring flexible interfaces.

13. **CRM Data Utilization:** Sales and business tools capture valuable data that could leverage future AI capabilities but is currently underutilized.

14. **Receipt Validation Challenges:** Varying invoice formats and insufficient test data create difficulties in validation processes.

15. **Role-based Interface Needs:** Users are overwhelmed by options that don't apply to their specific use cases, requiring simplified interfaces.

## System and Process Challenges

- **Data Fragmentation:** ETL failures between systems cause data inconsistencies, with failures sometimes going unaddressed for weeks.

- **Manual Processes:** Numerous time-consuming manual workflows including merchant information entry, offer verification, reporting, and asset collection.

- **Workflow Complexity:** Different processes for local merchants versus chains create inconsistent experiences and operational challenges.

## User Experience Insights

- **Local Merchant Needs:** Small business owners have limited time and technical expertise, describing their situation as "sweeping floors and cooking in the back" with marketing as a secondary concern.

- **Data Interpretation:** Raw metrics are difficult for clients to understand without context, leading to questions like "So what does this mean?"

- **Service Expectations:** Higher-paying clients expect white-glove service with direct access to account managers, while others would benefit from self-service tools.

## Primary Value Drivers

- Differentiation through superior analytics compared to competitors
- Increased efficiency through standardized, scalable products
- Better client retention through improved reporting and insights
- Faster time-to-market through self-service capabilities
- Reduced operational costs by automating manual processes
- Improved data quality through automated validation
- Enhanced merchant experience through streamlined workflows
- Better decision-making through integrated data sources
- Reduced "not honoring" issues through better merchant communication
- Improved ROI demonstration through benchmarking

## Risk Factors

- Transition from current systems requires careful change management
- Balancing standardization with customization needs
- Different requirements for different merchant types creates complexity
- Previous self-service attempts faced high abandonment rates
- Legacy systems limitations may impact integration capabilities
- Varying technical capabilities across merchants/partners may challenge implementation
- Fraud attempts will require ongoing monitoring and adaptation
- Information overload could reduce adoption if not properly managed

This research summary provides a consolidated view of the key challenges, opportunities, and considerations for the Kigo Pro platform development.
