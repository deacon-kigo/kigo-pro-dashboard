# AI Product Filter Agent - Project Requirements & Implementation

## üìã Executive Summary

This document consolidates all project requirements, acceptance criteria, implementation roadmap, and project management details for the AI Product Filter Agent. The project implements a multi-agent AI system inspired by enterprise solutions like JP Morgan's AskDavid to transform product filter creation from complex form-based processes into intuitive conversational experiences.

## üéØ Project Vision

Transform product filter creation from a complex form-based process into an intuitive conversational experience that guides users through filter definition, validation, and optimization.

### Architecture Approach

**Multi-Agent System Design** based on enterprise AI patterns:

- **Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrates conversation flow and routes requests
- **Specialized Agents**: Handle specific filter operations (criteria generation, analysis, etc.)
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Maintains user control with AI assistance
- **State Management**: Real-time synchronization between chat and form interfaces
