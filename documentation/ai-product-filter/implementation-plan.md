# AI Product Filter Agent - Project Requirements & Implementation

## üìã Executive Summary

This document consolidates project requirements, acceptance criteria, and implementation suggestions for the AI Product Filter Agent **proof of concept**. The prototype demonstrates a multi-agent AI system that transforms product filter creation from complex form-based processes into intuitive conversational experiences.

**Important Note**: This is a proof of concept implementation. All technical approaches, libraries, patterns, and implementation details are **suggestions only**. Development teams are free to choose their own technologies, architectures, and implementation strategies based on their requirements and preferences.

## üéØ Project Vision

Transform product filter creation from a complex form-based process into an intuitive conversational experience that guides users through filter definition, validation, and optimization.

### Prototype Architecture Approach

The POC demonstrates one possible approach using:

- **Multi-Agent System Design**: Supervisor agent orchestrating specialized agents
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language interaction with form synchronization
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: User control with AI assistance
- **Real-time Sync**: Chat and form interface synchronization

_Note: These are implementation suggestions. Production systems may use different patterns, libraries, or architectures based on team preferences and requirements._

User: "Yes, to 'Summer Flash Sale 2025'."

Agent: "Filter assigned. Would you like to preview the offer coverage?"
User: "Yes."

Agent: "This filter covers 2,800 offers in 10 states. Save and assign?"
User: "Yes."

Agent: "All set! Your filter 'Summer Essentials' is now active and linked to 'Summer Flash Sale 2025'. ‚úÖ"
