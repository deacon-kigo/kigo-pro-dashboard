# Kigo Pro Dashboard Component Library

Welcome to the Kigo Pro Dashboard component library. This Storybook documents our atomic design components and illustrates how they can be used to build complex interfaces.

## Purpose

This component library serves as:
- A design reference for UX/UI consistency
- Documentation for developers
- A playground for component testing and iteration
- The source of truth for our UI components

## Component Architecture

Our components follow the **Atomic Design** methodology, organizing UI elements into:

### Atoms
Basic building blocks (Button, Input, etc.) that can't be broken down further.

### Molecules
Combinations of atoms that form simple UI patterns (Form fields, search bars, etc.)

### Organisms
More complex components made of molecules and atoms (Headers, sidebars, etc.)

### Templates
Page-level components that arrange organisms into layouts.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Browse through the components in the sidebar
2. Each component has documented props, variants and examples
3. Use the controls panel to experiment with different props
4. Reference the code tab to see how to implement the component

## Component Status

Components are tagged with their current development status:
- ‚úÖ **Stable** - Ready for production use
- üîÑ **In Progress** - Being actively developed
- üìù **Planned** - On the roadmap but not started

## Integration with Production

Frontend developers can pull these components from the prototype repository for use in production applications. The code is structured to be easily adaptable to specific requirements while maintaining design consistency.

## Future Plans

We will continue to expand this library with additional components and incorporate the Kigo brand design system from the Kigo Web SDKs repository.
